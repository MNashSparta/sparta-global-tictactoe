# sparta-global-tictactoe

This repo was created for a homework in Week 3 of the Sparta bootcamp.

The aim of this homework was to complete a recreation of Tic Tac Toe using HTML and Javascript.

The completed site allows a player and randomised computer opponent to take turns moving until one player has won or a draw is reached.
